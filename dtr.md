### DTR

Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Aliya Merali + Jamison Griffith

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
   * Application of key curriculum concepts 
   * Practice working in pairs, navigating a coding partnership 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
   * We want to wrok on finding a balance between the more prescriptive approach to process (e.g. driver/navigator roles) that is more of Aliya's strength, and the more organic approach (thinking big picture about the "why") that is more of Jamison's strength. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
   * Weekdays: Plan to work 5pm - 8pm after class, keep space open for alignment 8 - 8:45am before class
   * Weekend: Plan to work on Saturday, leave Sunday as a day off
   * We'll reevaluate this schedule and our progress in the re-DTR session on Friday

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
   * We'll plan to check in during all the scheduled work times via Slack at a minimum, likely live coding 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
   * See one / do one / teach one: Try to leverage this process for things when we start working on something one of us may not be familiar with 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
   * N/A for this project

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
   * We'll mostly pair live for the programming (leveraging branches)
   * We'll refactor by divide and conquer (leveraging branches + PR review)

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
   * We'll try using Pomodoro schedule to help break up our work schedule and commit frequently

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
   * Acknowledgement: recognize the work that has been done
   * Specific, kind, actionable 

Additional Remote Considerations:
   * Honesty and clarity: speak up if we're not on the same page about what/why we're doing 

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
   * We'll use Miro for project planning and mapping out our classes

Day 1 Agenda: 
   * 2:35: Look over project scope 
   * 2:50: Project plan / work on Miro mapping 
   * Target 1-2h coding working sessions
