### DTR

Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Aliya Merali + Jamison Griffith

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
   * Application of key curriculum concepts 
   * Practice working in pairs, navigating a coding partnership 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
   * Flexibility and alignment on overall project when it comes to working in driver/navigator roles as well as divide and conquer roles.
   * Consistency of alignment on project goals

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
   * Weekdays: Plan to work in a two-hour block after class-time, be flexible for alignment 8:30 - 8:45am before class
   * Weekend: Plan to tackle large problem together on Saturday AM (10am), realign at 2pm. Leave Sunday as a day off

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
   * We'll plan to check in during all the scheduled work times via Slack at a minimum, likely live coding 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
   * See one / do one / teach one: Try to leverage this process for things when we start working on something one of us may not be familiar with 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
   * Aim for iteration 4, but prioritize wellness.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
   * We'll mostly pair live for the programming (leveraging branches)
   * We'll refactor by divide and conquer (leveraging branches + PR review)

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
   * Implement using Pomodoro schedule on Saturday to help break up our work schedule and commit frequently

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
   * Acknowledgement: recognize the work that has been done
   * Specific, kind, actionable 

Additional Remote Considerations:
   * Honesty and clarity: speak up if we're not on the same page about what/why we're doing
