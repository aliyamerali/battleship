# Battleship

### Context
This was a paired coding project used to implement the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **Test-Driven Design**, and using **git** as version control. The project was written in **Ruby** and tested with **RSpec** over the course of a week and a half. Documentation on project specifications can be found at [Turing's Backend Engineering site](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship/index).

### Bonus Functionality
In addition to the features implemented in iteration 3, two bonus features were added:
- When starting a game, a user is be able to indicate the height and width of the board.
- The computer makes an educated guess of what coordinate to fire on-- it's actually hard.

### Demo
Run `ruby battleship_runner.rb` in a Terminal session to play the game:
